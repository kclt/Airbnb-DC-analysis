understanding what factors do customer care in choosing airbnb listings. While the second part looks to understand what are the relationship that affects the price
per night for listing in Washington DC by analysis the listings.csv file in InsideAirBnB dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

To understand what customer cares about, we can infer indirectly from their reviews left on the listing. 

### Reviews

The number of reviews have slowly increased over time which in general follows the trend of Airbnb's increase in popularity over this period.

From the above chart, it is well observed that the number of comments left steady increased over
the years. This can be explained with the increase popularity of AirBnB over the past decade
and the increase in the number of the listing posting in Washington DC. Though, we can observe
fluctuations of the number of reviews left during a single year. Taking a sample within a year - 2017, we can observe reviews spikes and drops throughout the
years. For example, Feb 2017 was an exceptionally warm February which cause a strong spike in
tourist visiting DC. Another example are events such as April - May 2017 - Cherry Blossom period
in DC.

#### Sentiment Analysis

As there is no preclassification of reviews, we use transfer learning of a pre-trained model (VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)) which is tuned to sentiments expressed in social media to label the reviews left at Airbnb. The model generates negative, positive, and neutral score for each review and create a compound score where it classify if a review is positive or negative.

From the above, we can observe that majority of the reviews are perceived as neutral reviews with
slight positivity, and not a lot of negative reviews. Thus this shows that most reviews left are positive things that customers like about their stays though it does not reveal too much about what. Thus we conduct topic modeling to see what are the common themes of these positive/neutral reviews. 

#### Topic modeling through LDA

To better understanding what peoplare interested, we conduct Topic modeling with LDA to cluster word groups and similar expressions that best characterize the reviews. After removing puncationas and stop words, we covert tokenize and normalize each reviews (document) and create document term matrix. Then applying LDA to find topics.

To determine the optimal number of topics, we calculate the coherence score (which assses the quality of the learn topics) and conduct a grid search by repeating the process for various number of topics.

As the coherence score does not linear increase, we choose the value that elbow value before the high fluctuation of coherence score (6 topics). The results are these following six cluster of words.

which we then look through the words and assign a topic to these six clusters of words respectively:

From the Topic modelling, we find that user talks a lot about Airbnb location, and the experience during the stay. This is further reinforced with the description of the listing with location of the Airbnb / nearby sightseeing locations as the most common words used.
